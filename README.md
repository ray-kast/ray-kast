# Hi!

Iâ€™m Ryan, a serial tinkerer, [Linux user], and [longtime][fractal1]
[enthusiast][fractal2] [of][fractal3] [fractals][fractal4].

I enjoy listening to (and attempting to make) music, computer graphics,
compilers and programming languages, and long walks on the beach.

My projects include:
- Utilities or libraries like [`empress`], [`dispose`], and [`topograph`]
- Stuff made for fun like [a Discord bot][the-q], [a TUI word game][omelette],
  or a [Ruby script that generates a meme][loss-system]
- Some of the [rcfiles I use across all my POSIX-like machines][zrc] alongside
  a very overengineered shell config to manage it all
